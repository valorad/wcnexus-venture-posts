## Sorting

There would be a couple of days before I officially became tainted.

A common story would have a whole bunch of backround stories and introductions that even inconsistency happens, but nobody really care about that, does he?

So everything I could do was:

``` html

<div>
  <img src="404.jpg" alt="404">
  <b style="font-size: 80px; transform: translateY(50%)">Work work work</b>
</div>

```

...was: 

``` javascript

module.exports = () => {
  let test = "3";
  conosle.log("think");
  conosle.error("think");
  alert("think");
  conosle.warn(test);
}

```

...and: 

``` C#
using Console;

private void main() {
  BDK bFetcher = new BDK();
  for (int i = 0; i < BDK.length; i++) {
    bFetcher.fetch(i);
    Console.writeLine("Fetch BDK " + i.toString());
  }
}
```

... However, `stackoverflow` and `github` would be all what I eventually need.
